Are you on top of food trends? Have you heard of the cronut, the cruffin or the tacro? How about sushirrito? These items of food have one thing in common: They are fusions of two different types of food! 

I plan on looking at restaurant menus and food types in order to help you create your new food truck item or restaurant menu! You can be at the forefront of the new restaurant craze or the new food hype! Are you looking to create your Mexican/Thai restaurant? I can help you come up with menu items fusing things from both restaurant types.
